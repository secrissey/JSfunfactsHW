    <h1>What are Promises?</h1>
</div>

<p>A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future : either a resolved value, or a reason that it's not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). ... Promises are eager, meaning that a promise will start doing whatever task you give it as soon as the promise constructor is invoked.</p>
